# ReinaToken - A Solidity Smart Contract

This repository contains the smart contract for the Reina Token, a decentralized cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The Reina Token is designed to facilitate transactions and interactions within its ecosystem, leveraging the power of blockchain technology for secure and transparent operations.

## Overview

The Reina Token contract includes functionalities such as:

- **Ownership**: The contract has an owner who can perform certain actions like minting new tokens.
- **Minting**: Allows the owner to create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.
- **Transferring**: Enables token holders to send tokens to other addresses.
- **Burning**: Provides functionality for token holders to destroy tokens, reducing the total supply.
